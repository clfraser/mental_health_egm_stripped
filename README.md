# Self-harm in children and young people evidence and gap map (stripped down version)

This app will soon (likely by the end of March 2025) be published to the [Public Health Scotland website](https://publichealthscotland.scot/population-health/mental-health/prevention-of-mental-ill-health-and-improved-wellbeing/mental-health-evidence-and-addressing-gaps/). It is a stripped-down version of the [full self-harm in children and young people evidence and gap map](https://github.com/clfraser/mental_health_egm_full/), which also included information like a glossary and useful links. These are soon to be moved to the Public Health Scotland website, rather than the app itself.

## Structure of the app

* Run the app by opening app.R and clicking 'Run' in the top right hand corner
* `setup.R` contains required packages and is where any data should be read in
* `data` is a folder for storing data to be read in (not available on GitHub). This data is processed in the data_preparation script.
* `www` contains the app stylesheets and PHS icon images
* `server` contains server functions
* `ui` contains UI functions
* `functions` contains R scripts with functions for the app
